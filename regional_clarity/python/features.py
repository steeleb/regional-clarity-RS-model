"""Spectral index feature engineering.

Optical candidates are curated to raw bands plus ratios/indices with
specific literature precedent or clear physical explainability, rather
than an exhaustive sweep of every possible band combination:

  - BR (blue/red): Kloiber et al.'s canonical Landsat Secchi-depth ratio,
    the basis of the statewide Minnesota/Wisconsin clarity mapping
    programs.
  - BG (blue/green): classic ocean-color chlorophyll-a ratio.
  - NR (nir/red): established chlorophyll-a ratio for turbid inland
    waters.
  - GR (green/red): same chlorophyll-absorption-contrast logic as BG/NR,
    adjacent-band pairing.
  - NDVI, FAI, NDSSI: standard, independently well-cited named indices.
  - NDWI, MNDWI: McFeeters (1996) and Xu (2006) respectively.

Reciprocal ratios, 2-band-sum ratios, and other ad-hoc combinations
without a specific citation are not included as candidates - they added
volume to correlation pruning without a corresponding justification for
why that particular combination should matter.

    waterbody's static LakeCat values - identical for every site and every

    (see pull_site_characteristics.Rmd) - can't act as a de facto waterbody
    ID for the model to key a memorized SDD value off of ("this is
    Pathfinder, therefore SDD = X").

    This is a general overfitting guard for the ~560 single-HUC8
    waterbodies, not a leakage fix: the handful of waterbodies that span
    more than one HUC8 and therefore straddle a CV/holdout boundary (Lake
    Powell chief among them - project memory partition-sensitivity-findings)
    stay just as distinguishable after coarsening as before, by design,
    since they're large enough that no reasonable resolution reduction
    collides them with anything else. That's intentional - we keep them in
    train/val (project decision: report test metrics with and without the
    overlapping reservoirs, rather than drop the data) and coarsening
    doesn't need to (and can't) paper over that separately-documented
    leakage.

    catchment_area_sqkm: log-scale binning (round log10 to 1 decimal, i.e.
    ~26% multiplicative bands) rather than a fixed-km2 grid, because the
    underlying distribution spans ~5 orders of magnitude (0.16-20,188 km2,
    median 6.7 km2 across the 564 waterbodies in this dataset) - a flat
    absolute rounding grid either guts resolution at the small end (where
    most of the data lives) or does nothing at the large end depending
    which grid size you pick, whereas log-scale gives uniform relative
    resolution loss across the whole range.
