"""HUC8-random spatial cross-validation: a fixed universal holdout plus
several independent, randomly-balanced 4-fold CV arrangements of the
remaining pool.

Replaces the original HUC4-greedy-bin-pack split (03_split_data.Rmd, one
fixed 5-way partition): the partition-sensitivity investigation found that
HUC4-level splitting concentrates hard basins (Lake Powell, the HUC 1701
lake cluster) into single partitions structurally, and that randomizing at
the HUC8 level instead - averaged over several independent random seeds -
recovers 10-18% of that unevenly-distributed error (project memory
"partition-sensitivity-findings"). One fixed holdout keeps every ensemble
seed's final evaluation directly comparable; multiple independent 4-fold
CV arrangements average out any single split's idiosyncratic HUC-basin
placement during feature/hyperparameter selection and training.
