"""Cross-fold-consensus backward feature elimination with shadow-decoy
stopping. Every decision - which feature to drop, when to stop - is made
from out-of-fold CV (partitions 1-4) only; the test partition (5) is never
touched by this module.

Algorithm, per model, fixed hyperparameters throughout:
  1. Start from a candidate set (already correlation-pruned).
  2. Add one shadow feature per real candidate - a row-permuted copy with
     the same marginal distribution but no relationship to the target,
     re-randomized every step. A trained model's own permutation
     importance for a shadow column is the noise floor: any real feature
     that doesn't clearly beat it is behaving like noise to this model.
  3. Train all 4 fold models fresh, compute every feature's (real +
     shadow) permutation importance on that fold's own held-out
     validation split (never train, never test), averaged across folds.
  4. Drop the worst real feature if its importance is at or below the
     shadow floor, and repeat from step 2.
  5. Stop when either (a) the worst remaining real feature already beats
     the shadow floor, or (b) mean CV RMSE has degraded by more than
     `tol` (relative) from the best point seen on the path - a safety net
     for cases where importance ranking and realized CV error disagree.
